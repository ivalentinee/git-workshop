  Explore commits in "master-merge-copy"
description: |
  Run `git show HEAD`, `git show HEAD^`, `git show HEAD^^^`
  Run `git show HEAD^2`, `git show HEAD^2^^`, `git show HEAD^2^^2` (which goes the second root)
  Explain why git behaves like that
text: |
  Look at
    Merge commit (HEAD)
    Previous commit (HEAD^)
    Pre-pre-previous commit from first parent (HEAD^^^)

    Previous commit from "another-branch-merge-copy" (HEAD^2)
    "another-branch-merge-copy" "master" merge commit parent 1 (HEAD^2^^)
    "another-branch-merge-copy" "master" merge commit parent 2 (HEAD^2^^2)
hint: |
  git show HEAD
  git show HEAD^
  git show HEAD^^^

  git show HEAD^2
  git show HEAD^2^^
  git show HEAD^2^^2
result: |
  Merge branch 'another-branch-merge-copy' into master-merge-copy
  master: added "third line"
  add file2.txt

  another-branch: added "fourth line"
  another-branch: added "third line part 2"
  master: added "third line"
